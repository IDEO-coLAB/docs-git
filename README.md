## <a name="git"></a>Version Control: Git

We currently use `Git` for version control in the CoLab.

### External Resources

If you're unfamiliar with `Git`, it is an *extremely useful* tool, and one that we use daily. You'll need to familiarie yourself with the basics in order to work with, and contribute to, CoLab engineering projects.

#### Learning
- [In-browser interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) (from Github)
- [Official 'get started' docs](https://git-scm.com/documentation)

## <a name="github"></a>Source Hosting: GitHub

We host all of our repos under the [CoLab organization](https://github.com/IDEO-coLAB) on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

### Finding Relevant Code

We use (relatively) strict naming conventions to create namespaces for CoLab's core repos. Simply search using any relevant namespace to filter out unnecessary repos. See the examples below.

#### `docs-*`

All CoLab documentation repos are prefixed with `docs-*`. You can pull up all CoLab docs by simply searching for `docs-` using the CoLab organization's search bar.

#### `forkable-*`

All CoLab forkable base repos are prefixed with `forkable-*`. You can pull up all CoLab forkable base repos by simply searching for `forkable-` using the CoLab the organization's search bar.

- **`forkable-<language>-*`**: The `forkable-` namespace is succeeded by another namespace for the base repo's primary language. For example, the CoLab's React forkable repo is primarily a javascript project. As such, it is named `forkable-js-react-static`, following the `forkable-<language>-*` convention. Now you can find all forkable base repos in in your language of choice!
